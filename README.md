                                            POKEMON APP
Application made on purpose of showcasing iOS developing and Swift skills, utilized https://pokeapi.co/.

For now displaying a list of pokemons initially and details for each pokemon selected in another screen.

Since it's a small app I used MVVM pattern so it is more modular, easier to test/maintain, and scalable in the future if needed.

Used Kingfisher library for downloading and caching images - https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher

For network communication used URLSession, could switch to Alamofire in future - https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire
